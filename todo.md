# TODO

## dotfiles
- \_awsAliases should have a sanity check to be sure aws cli is installed
  - the makesymlinks.sh should only set up \_awsAliases if the AWS CLI is installed.
- better error/sanity checks in makesymlinks.sh
- allow makesymlinks.sh to keep X copies of older dotfiles.
- put some smart in makesymlinks.sh to allow the AWS profile switcher to automagically set the correct AWS account to use.
- need to work out how to bring AWS creds over safely
- more power to the profile
